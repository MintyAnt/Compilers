Optimize Autovec

Cool Optimizations:
- if (false) { }  gets removed (use debugger)

- x = 0 is turned into xor x, x

int x;
x = 0;

What I expect:
mov x, 0

What really comes:
xor x, x

- Linking functions
2 functions do the same shit
Compiles down to one function

- Static, const strings all point to the same damned one

- Loop Unrolling

- Auto-Vectorization


Assembly vs Assembly:
Show unoptimized assembly against optimized assembly.
What you expect, too, would be smart

How to use the debugger:
Show off cool debugger things
Show off how to jump into assembly
Show off how to move breakpoint around
Show off how to keep track of variables
